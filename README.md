# QuikQuiz

QuikQuiz is a lightweight, interactive quiz app built with **Next.js (App Router)**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**.  
Users can browse quiz categories, choose a difficulty level, answer 10 multiple-choice questions, and instantly view their results — including a visual correct vs wrong breakdown using **Chart.js**.

The app is designed as a clean portfolio project with a real-world structure: quiz data is served via **Next.js API routes**, results are calculated through a dedicated API endpoint, and the quiz flow is protected using **sessionStorage** to prevent invalid navigation (like opening results without finishing a quiz).
