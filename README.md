# QuikQuiz

A lightweight, interactive quiz app built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind. Users can choose a quiz category, answer multiple-choice questions, and see their results instantly. The app features dynamic routing, session-based progress tracking, a results page with charts, and light/dark mode support. All quiz data is served via Next.js API routes, simulating a real backend without a database, making it a perfect showcase of modern Next.js skills and client-side interactivity.
